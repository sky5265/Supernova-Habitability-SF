This one would probably be about flux and luminosity

---
When we look out in space, what we see are many many sources of light. 
Specifically, sources of electromagnetic radiation. EM radiation can be in 
any wavelength, ranging from Radio to microwave to IR, all the way up to 
gamma radiation. Radio is the longest wavelength, lowest frequency radiation and Gamma is 
the shortest-wavelength, highest-frequency radiation

[maybe have some figure showing the EM spectrum]

duality]

So now, imagine a source of radiation in space-like a star or something. 
[picture of a nice bright star-probably just stick with our Sun]

The picture above is probably the star that you are most familiar with. 
It's our Sun! Our Sun has a luminosity (total brightness) of --- W. This 
is as bright as --- flashlights [or use some other benchmark of 
brightness]. So, it puts out this much energy in total, but we only get a 
little bit of it. This is something you've seen before too! Imagine a 
car's headlight-when it's really far away, it appears much dimmer than 
when it's up close [show a picture of that too].
So when we talk about how bright things actually are in the sky versus
how bright they seem to be to us, we need to account for how far away they 
are. 

Let's now draw a distinction between Luminosity and flux. Luminosity is 
the total power output of an object. This is the total amount of energy 
(measured in units of J, for Joules) that's being emitted per second (s). 
So, lumionsity is the total power output of an object measured in Joules 
per second. J/s is also called a Watt. You might have seen a light bulb 
that puts out 60 Watts of power. That means the light bulb is putting out 
60 Joules of energy every second through the light it gives off. 
[picture of a light bulb]

Now, imagine all of that energy that's emitted by the bulb. The bulb is 
equally bright in every direction. This means it is an isotropic 
emitter-it emits equally in all direction. So, imagine all of that energy 
as it moves away from the central light bulb. The further this light gets 
from the light bulb the more area all of this energy has to travel 
through. At a distance d from the light bulb, the energy emitted by the 
light bulb must travel through a total area equal to the surface area of a 
sphere centered on the bulb with radius equal to d. [draw pictures and 
animations of this]. So, the flux that you get per unit area along this 
sphere would be L/4*pi*d^2.

Imagine our Sun's light and the Earth receiving this light. Stars are also 
isotropic emitters, so the whole analogy with the light bulb works. All of 
the power that the sun emits must travel through a sphere whose radius 
equals the distance from the Earth to the Sun. [show a picture] So, the 
flux from the Sun that would be detected on the Earth would be 
L_\odot/4*pi*(1AU)^2. If we had a detector on the Earth that was 1m x 1m, 
it would detect a flux of L_\odot/4*pi*(1AU)^2 * (1m)^2 = --.
