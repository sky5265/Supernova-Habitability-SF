# Supernova-Habitability-SF

## This is a repository of the high school science fair project I hope to do, that has to do with finding the habitability within the Milky Way Galaxy by exploding supernovae.

## The question that will be answered by this project is: How many supernovae need to go off in the galaxy per unit time for the average location in the galaxy to be habitable?

## More details are in the Brainstorming.txt file.
